Training for 4788 Episodes over night on GTX 1070

System is performing really well right now. Always landing on pad and not hovering really improved performance and
made training a little harder too. It reached its peak performance in terms of reward at episode 500 but as always there
is still some improvement happening because overall reward is not everything.

Starts out learning fine. Peaks at Episode 600. Then there is noticable decay in performance happening. Another good
policy at 1500. Another performance peak at Episode 1900. Probably the best till then. Sometimes hovers awkwardly
but at least doesnt slam the pad to hard. 3000 is also good but sometimes, even in simple situations, it just performs
horribly. The later ones are getting super aggressive. To aggressive to be robust and only having such a good average
performance because they get really good scores sometimes. 4788 looking quite good again but sometimes its hovering a bit too much.

Overall winner is 1900. It can even perform a lite Starship Belly-Flip Maneuvre, just set:
x = -30
y = -60
phi = 1.0
y_v = 30
