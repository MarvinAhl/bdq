Training for 9643 Episodes for over 24h on GTX 1070

Turned out about as good as ne last one. Still mostly landet off pad.
Later policies didn't add anything interesting. Solid performance anyways.

Greatest weakness is landing off pad and flying up again. Soft Rewards didn't help
so I will end the episode as a failure when the y velocity is negative (flying upwards)
or touchdown is not in the landing zone.

Furthermore I will try to increase stability by adding some randomness to the initial
downwards velocity. Random spawn x-Point is now also determined by normal 
distribution because coming in from the extreme sides of the screen is actually just
supposed to be an edge case. Making NN a little bigger by the way.
