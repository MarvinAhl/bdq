Training for 3081 Episodes over night on GTX 1070

Turned out a lot better than I expected for the first time but BDQ with
time correlated randomness in e-greedy seems to be doing the job! It actally lands successfully
most of the time from about episode 400 on. Which is not a lot!

A few changes will be done to reward function though:
Reward for landing on pad. There is not reward other than the shaping for landing successfully
on pad so that's gonna be added.
Slightly increased fuel cost because sometimes it is good but then hovers for an eternety before
finally touching down. Increasing from -0.01 to -0.02.

Hyperparameters seem to be doing great so no changes there. Only changed up the randomness
to the exploration strategy a little. Now actions can independently be random and not
everything random or everything optimal at once.

Control nozzles seem to have a little too much power, it shouldn't rely on them too much,
I will train one without them in the future but for now they are fine.
